                Dr Kwame Nkrumah(21 September 1909 - 27 April 1972) was a Ghanaian politician, political theorist, and revolutionary. He served as Prime Minister of the Gold Coast from 1952 until 1957, when it gained independence from Britain.
                He was then the first Prime Minister and then the President of Ghana, from 1957 until 1966. An influential advocate of Pan-Africanism, Nkrumah was a founding member of the Organization of African 
                Unity and winner of the Lenin Peace Prize from the Soviet Union in 1962.
                He formed the Convention People's Party, which achieved rapid success through its unprecedented appeal to the common voter. He became Prime Minister in 1952 
                and retained the position when Ghana declared independence from Britain in 1957. In 1960, Ghanaians approved a new constitution and elected Nkrumah President.
                He fostered a personality cult, forming ideological institutes and adopting the title of 'Osagyefo Dr.'.
